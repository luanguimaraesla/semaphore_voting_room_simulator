## Semaphore Voting Room Simulator
This repository contains a simple c program to demonstrate how does the semaphores work between multiple processes using UNIX shared memory.  
All the explanation about the problem is in the doc folder but unfortunately it's available only in portuguese. However all the software was developed and commented out in English, maybe that's how you can enjoy it.

### How to use

1. Compile the software
```
cd semaphore_voting_room_simulator  
make
```  
2. Execute the program  
```
make run
```
3. To clear the object files  
```
make clean
```
